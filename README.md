# Fintech Banking Prediction Using Logistic Regression And Random Forest

## ‚ú® About The Project

In conducting marketing campaigns related to time deposits to its customers, the bank conducts several ways, namely through email marketing, advertising, telephone marketing, and digital marketing. Among these ways, telephone marketing campaigns still remain one of the most effective ways to reach people. The importance of early prediction of the success of marketing campaigns is because the effectiveness of customer participation plays a major role in the success of marketing campaigns. Therefore, it is very important to identify potential customers for term deposits by processing the bank's data so that the probability of a successful marketing campaign is greater. This certainly has a big effect on the efficiency of the bank in prioritizing customers who must be contacted and knowing whether the customer to be contacted has the potential to make a time deposit or not.

Based on several previous studies, the classification methods of Logistic Regression and Random Forest have good results. This research aims to analyze the comparison of two methods to predict the success of time deposit marketing campaigns, namely the Logistic Regression and Random Forest classification methods to find out which classification method has the best performance, and classification results are seen using the confusion matrix and ROC curve.

The dataset used in this study is a telephone time deposit marketing campaign data conducted by a bank. This study uses two datasets, namely train.csv and test.csv. The train.csv dataset consists of 45,211 rows with 18 columns and the test.csv dataset consists of 4,521 rows with 18 columns. The dataset consists of 16 feature attributes and 1 label attribute. A detailed description of the attributes and category values can be seen through the `Analisis Perbandingan Prediksi Kampanye Pemasaran Deposit Berjangka Menggunakan Metode Logistic Regression dan Random Forest` file.
